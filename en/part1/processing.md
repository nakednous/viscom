Processing is a programming environment and language created at the MIT Media Lab in 2001 by Ben Fry and Casey Reas. It's main goal is to provide a visual sketchbook and teaching environment for algorithmic literacy in the arts and visual literacy in the engineering. Processing users have created many pieces that explore animation, procedural rendering, user interaction.
