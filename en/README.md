# Visual Computing for Artists & Designers (and everyone else)

Visual Computing is the field that contains disciplines such as: 
 * Computer graphics and computer animation 
 * Image analysis and computer vision
 * Visualization and visual analytics 
 * Geometric modeling and 3D-printing
 * Image processing and image editing 
 * Virtual and augmented reality
 * Human computer interaction

Creative coders make use of techniques from these disciplines, through the use of programmings like Processing, OpenFrameworks, etc. In this book, we will focus on computer graphics and animation, human computer interaction in Processing by means of shaders and the ProScene library.
