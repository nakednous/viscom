Universal interaction tasks:

 1. 2D & 3D viewpoint manipulation
 2. Picking & Manipulation -> select & interaction
 3. Application Control -> 'post-'WIMP interaction metaphors


For a relatively recent survey please refer to: "A Survey of Interaction Techniques for Interactive 3D Environments", Jankowski et al., 2013 - STAR.

2. Appropriation through collaboration: open-sourcing the materials to encourage hacking them
