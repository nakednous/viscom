# BIAS

## Goal

> Provide interactivity to _application objects_ from any _gesture input source_

in the simplest possible way:

1. API simplicity & flexibility
2. Customizability

* API simplicity may be evaluated from the set of instructions needed to accomplish a standard task over a given domain
* API flexibility is related to as whether or not an advanced task can be accomplished by the
framework and if so, how.
* Software maintenance and extensibility, such as when adding new hardware and/or application
user-defined actions.s
